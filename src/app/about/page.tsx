          {`I started my computer science journey in high school when my math class had a project involving creating fractal
          patterns using the graphical programming language Scratch. I enjoyed using Scratch so much, that I ended up creating
          a round based zombies top-down shooter game, emulating the Call of Duty Zombies video game. From that moment, I fell
          in love with the logical processes and problem solving of programming. I continued taking more computer science classes
          in high school, over the summer at Stanford, and eventually at Northeastern University, where I majored in computer science.`}

          {`I started my professional software developer experience as a backend developer building REST APIs and microservices during
          my first co-op at Intuit, but I was always interested in the frontend. During my second co-op at Intuit, I took the opportunity
          to enroll in a 2 week class that tought JavaScript and React and from there I knew that's what I wanted to focus on. I love the
          aspect of frontend development that changes are instantly visable to see and that users will be interacting directly with those
          changes. I particularly enjoy the component architecture of React and getting to focus on what building blocks I want to use to
          build the UI, as opposed to thinking about how exactly the UI is rendered (although I still think about that too). To me, it makes
          building a UI like building with Lego blocks. I honed my React skills while working at Meta in 2019, where I built a web app for
          Meta data center maintenance requests. I've been working as a full time frontend engineer since then. I continue to stay up to date
          on my frontend skills through taking online courses in my free time, such as Kent C Dodd's Epic React and Josh W Comeau's CSS for
          JavaScript Developers.`}

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          {`The Northeastern University curriculum heavily involves work experience in the form of co-ops. Co-ops are typically a 6 month long
          professional work experience that are built into the undergraduate experience. While part of the curriculum, I still had to apply to
          job postings, complete coding challenges, and go through technical and behavioral interviews before being hired for these roles that
          were paid and required working 40 hours a week. I like to think of co-op as in between an internship and full time experience. While
          on a co-op, I'm there long enough to take on more responsibilities than an intern, but I'm not full time. As a result of the co-op
          program, my work experience as a software engineer started during my second year of college when I got my first co-op at Intuit in
          San Diego. Read more below to learn about my full time, co-op, and internship experiences. I wrote blurbs for these instead of the bullet
          points you can find on my résumé.`}

          {`Besides software development, I've always had a passion for music, YouTube, and video games. In middle school and high school, I
          combined my passion for video games and YouTube by creating my own gaming channel, where I would upload Call of Duty game play videos.
          This process tought me how to record content, edit videos, add voiceovers, and create video thumbnails using photoshop. It was always for
          fun and a hobby of mine, but I managed to amass 32,000 subscribers during my time uploading gaming videos.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          {`I stopped uploading gaming videos once I started college, but that's when I was able to pursue another passion of mine, music.
          I'd always played music throughout my life, starting with the violin in elementary school, then the drums in a rock band with my
          friends in middle school, and then the trumpet in jazz band in high school. Once college started, there wasn't a structured time
          for me to play music like there was previously, but I had always wanted to play guitar and it just so happened that my suitemate
          in my freshman year dorm room knew how to play. Through my college suitemate acting as a motivator and YouTube tutorials, I tought
          myself how to play electric guitar. I found that the best way for me to learn was to learn how to play the guitar parts for songs
          I like. I particularly like listening and playing rock and indie rock music, such as, The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, Last Dinosaurs, etc.
          Combine that with being able to play multiple guitar parts along with my roommate, and I had the motivation I needed to learn.
          After a couple years of playing guitar and being able to learn and play most of the songs I like to listen to, I decided to start
          uploading guitar covers to a new YouTube channel, bringing back my old passion of YouTube and making videos. It was also a way for
          me to keep track of the songs I knew how to play. It taught me how to record to an audio interface, edit videos with music, and
          music production. Learning guitar, recording covers, and producing guitar audio even inspired me to get a music minor during my time
          at Northeastern. You can checkout my guitar cover channel below:`}
